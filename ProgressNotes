    !! current problem, localstorage stores false but still displays true
     -> using string 'dark'/'' rather than true/false state 
    -localstorage stores as type:string
    -darkmode set to 'class' in tailwindcss
    - dunno what the ... in props

    - added headlessui for darkmode
    ! svg should change when button is toggled (off - lightmode, on - darkmode)
    ! put transition when svg is changed 
    - carry over enable state to parent 
    - REFER to other components dropdown,navlink,responsive navlink (howd they do it)
    - making darkmodetoggle as a component export
    darkmode done, used string with boolean effect ('','dark')

    - added npm heroicon so i dont have to individually download svg
